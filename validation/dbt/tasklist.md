- [x] read raw input data from data/train.csv into raw_housing
    - write failing test for row count in raw/schema.yml using dbt-expectations
    - use DBT seed command (this is against a [DBT best practice](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/seeds) for loading dynamic data into DB, we are using it here just for concise tutorial )

- [ ] add a check for Id field unique and not null in raw_houses/schema.yml
  - comment: Unfortunately I don't know how to test this type validation actually works we can't expect a test to produce an exception or faiilure easily. I just did an ad-hoc test and decided to trust after that... :( I experimented with jinja unit tests but the mock data there doesn't go through the schema tests.


- [ ] staging column stg_houses reads data from the raw table and applies formatting checks. 
    - in staging/schema.yml write failing test for column names using dbt-expectations
    - make the test pass by only selecting the right columns
    - on green, think about refactoring. Would you like to rename fields to have more readable names? Do they have to be the same as CSV column names? Renaming in staging is a DBT best practice in the Do Not Repeat Yourself principle.
    - run `dbt build --full-refresh` to recreate the DB and run everything
    

- [ ] column data types validation
    -  run the test on command line using 'dbt test' or 'dbt test --store-failures' command
       - id you use `dbt test --store-failures` then you can inspect the failures in db by using 'duckcli houses.duckdb'
       - you can also see what the test actually does by clicking on a link to complied code in the console, like  `compiled Code at target/compiled/houses/models/staging/schema.yml/dbt_expectations_expect_column_dfc73812841a97c03866cb28a5063a04.sql`
    -  see a test for Id column having data type integer in staging/schema.yml line 22 using dbt-expectations

    - add remaining column type tests
  
- [ ] Null values
  - how are null values marked in the CSV? It is NA word, not null
  - use NULLIF to convert the FireplaceQu column to nulls if the text is NA. It is important to do it, as we mock the data in unit tests, and we need to know how to mock unit values correctly. I didn't do this step in my solution and ended up with a bug. :)

- [ ] when loading into staging, check the data format rule that FireplaceQuality has to be one of 'Ex', 'Gd', 'TA', 'Fa', 'Po', null
  - add the expect_column_values_to_be_in_set test to staging/schema.yml using dbt-expectations
  - run it using dbt test command
  - do you see the errors? how does the test deal with null values? 
  - One suggest is to add to the test row_condition that the FireplaceQuality field is not null, and remove the null vaue from the valid set

- [ ] First business rule. "If Fireplaces is greater than 0, then FireplaceQu is required." Don't load row into the houses prod table from staging stg_houses if the business rule is failed. 
    - See a regression unit test for creating a valid house in staging, and then checking it is copied to prod table in tests/unit_tests.sql It is using the clever dbt-testing library from Equal Experts
    - uncomment a failing test that creates two rows in staging - one valid and one invalid. And expects only one of them to pass to prod. 
    - see the nice error message running dbt test
    - Add another common table SQL expression in houses.sql to make the test pass


- [ ] validation YearBuilt
    - write a failing test in tests/unit_tests.sql for creating a House row with  yearbuilt 2000.
    - make it pass by creating another CTE in houses.sql only taking rows with YearBuilt value is between 1700 and 1900.
 

- [ ] validation firstfloor is at least one third of the 2nd floor
    
    - write a failing test for creating a House staging row with  1stFlrSF=10, 2ndFlrSF=50. Expect the house prod table to be empty.
    - make it pass. 

- [ ] check output is 15 rows. From other solutions, we expect to see 15 rows as output
    - add a row count check to to models/schema.yml
    - check it passes
    - this is not required but you can see the output in terminal with `duckcli houses.duckdb` and `select * from houses`
    - expect to see 15 houses, just as in the pydantic solution
